Repository for experiment examining exemplar vs. rule-based processes in individuals during learning. 

# Study abstract 
When learning new concepts, students tend to use either exemplar-based learning strategies (e.g. memorizing specific examples) or rule-based learning strategies (e.g. abstracting general rules). Prior research suggests that participants’ strategy choices during learning depend on individuals’ pre-existing learning tendencies, with some people being exemplar learners and others rule learners. Yet, strategy choices are also influenced by how the study materials are taught (rule-focused or exemplar-focused). The current study examined how these two factors interact using an alphanumeric symbol addition task. We examined whether exemplar learners would switch to using rule-based strategies when given rule-focused training and if rule learners would fail to learn the rule when given exemplar-focused training. We found that both rule and exemplar learners used a rule-based strategy after a rule-focused training and neither group learned the rule after an exemplar-focused training. Our results suggest that individuals can be shaped to adopt either rule-based or exemplar-based strategies during learning, regardless of their inherent learning tendencies.

# Study design
-  2 (training style: exemplar-focused, rule-focused) × 2 (learning style: exemplar learner, rule learner) between-subjects design. 
-  Participants were tested in two sessions with a 2-day delay.

# Task files (saved in lt_task)
- Participants in this study are asked to complete two tasks 
  - Session I : Training (Exemplar-focused vs. Rule-focused training tasks)
  - Session II: Learner classifications (identify individuals into three categories: exemplar, rule, and non learners)
